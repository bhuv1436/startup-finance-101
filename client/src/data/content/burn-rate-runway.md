# Burn Rate & Runway

*Reading time: 8 minutes*

## Introduction

Your burn rate and runway are critical financial metrics that determine how long your startup can operate before running out of cash. Understanding and managing these numbers is essential for sustainability, fundraising timing, and strategic planning. This guide provides a clear breakdown of these concepts for founders without a finance background.

## What is Burn Rate?

Burn rate is how quickly your company spends money, typically measured as a monthly rate. It's one of the most important financial metrics for startups, especially pre-profit ones.

There are two key types of burn rate:

- **Gross Burn Rate**: Total monthly expenses (e.g., $100,000/month)
- **Net Burn Rate**: Monthly expenses minus monthly revenue (e.g., $75,000/month)

## What is Runway?

Runway is how long your company can operate before running out of cash, assuming your burn rate stays constant and you don't raise additional funds or increase revenue.

The formula is simple:

> Runway (months) = Current Cash Balance √∑ Monthly Net Burn Rate

For example, if you have $500,000 in the bank and spend $50,000 more than you make each month, your runway is 10 months.

## Why These Metrics Matter

- **Fundraising Planning**: Allows you to start raising money before you run out (typically 6-9 months before)
- **Resource Allocation**: Helps prioritize spending on what drives growth
- **Operational Decisions**: Informs hiring pace, marketing spend, and expansion timing
- **Investor Confidence**: Shows financial discipline and responsible cash management
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Longer runway gives more time to adapt to market changes

## Calculating Your Burn Rate

To calculate your monthly burn rate:

1. **Track all expenses** (salaries, rent, software, marketing, etc.)
2. **Measure monthly revenue** (if any)
3. **Calculate the difference** between expenses and revenue

Key expense categories to monitor:
- Payroll (typically 60-75% of expenses)
- Office space
- Software and tools
- Marketing and sales
- Professional services (legal, accounting)

## Managing Your Burn Rate

Strategies to optimize your burn rate:

- **Zero-based budgeting**: Justify every expense from scratch each period
- **Focus on unit economics**: Ensure customer acquisition costs make sense
- **Outsource non-core functions**: Use contractors for specialized work
- **Negotiate better terms** with vendors and service providers
- **Implement spending controls**: Approval processes for larger expenses

## Common Burn Rate Mistakes

- **Ignoring seasonal variations** in revenue or expenses
- **Underestimating true costs** of hiring (benefits, equipment, etc.)
- **Setting fixed burn targets** rather than tying to growth metrics
- **Cutting essential growth investments** to artificially lower burn
- **Not having enough buffer** for unexpected costs or delays

## Did You Know?

üí° **Investor Perspective**: Most venture capitalists recommend maintaining at least 12-18 months of runway at all times. During economic downturns, this recommendation often increases to 24+ months.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The "default alive" vs. "default dead" framework (coined by investor Paul Graham) suggests that if your current growth and burn rate don't lead to profitability before your cash runs out, you're "default dead" and need to change course immediately.

*Remember: The goal isn't always to minimize burn‚Äîit's to optimize it. Strategic spending that drives growth can be worth a higher burn rate, while wasteful spending at any level is harmful.*
