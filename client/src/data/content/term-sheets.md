# Term Sheets

*Reading time: 15 minutes*

## Introduction

A term sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms and conditions of a potential investment. It serves as a blueprint for the more detailed legal agreements that will follow. Understanding term sheets is crucial for founders, as the terms you agree to now will impact your startup's governance, future fundraising, and potential exits for years to come.

## What is a Term Sheet?

Think of a term sheet as a concise summary of the most important aspects of a deal, typically 3-10 pages long. While non-binding (except for confidentiality and exclusivity provisions), term sheets set expectations and form the basis for the final agreements.

The goal of the term sheet is to ensure that investors and founders are aligned on key terms before spending time and money on full legal documentation.

## Key Components of a Term Sheet

### Economic Terms

- **Valuation**: Pre-money and post-money valuation of your company
- **Investment Amount**: How much the investors are putting in
- **Type of Security**: Usually preferred stock with special rights
- **Option Pool**: Percentage reserved for future employees (typically comes from founders' ownership)
- **Dividends**: Whether preferred stock accrues dividends (typically 6-8% annually)
- **Liquidation Preference**: How proceeds are distributed in an exit (typically 1x non-participating)

### Control Terms

- **Board Composition**: Who gets seats on the board of directors
- **Protective Provisions**: Special voting rights for investors on major decisions
- **Information Rights**: What financial information investors receive
- **Pro-rata Rights**: Investors' right to maintain ownership percentage in future rounds
- **Drag-along Agreement**: Ability to force all shareholders to approve a sale
- **Right of First Refusal**: Investors' right to purchase shares before they're sold to others

## Understanding Investor-Friendly vs. Founder-Friendly Terms

### Investor-Friendly Terms

- **Multiple on liquidation preference** (e.g., 2x instead of 1x)
- **Participating preferred** (double-dipping in distributions)
- **Full ratchet anti-dilution** protection
- **Investor-heavy board** composition
- **Extensive veto rights** on company decisions
- **Senior position** to all other equity

### Founder-Friendly Terms

- **Simple 1x non-participating** liquidation preference
- **Weighted average anti-dilution** protection
- **Founder-controlled board**
- **Limited protective provisions**
- **Single class of preferred** stock
- **Minimal or no dividends**

## How to Negotiate a Term Sheet

### Preparation

1. **Understand market standards**: Research typical terms for your stage, industry, and geography
2. **Know your leverage**: Multiple interested investors improve your negotiating position
3. **Prioritize terms**: Decide which terms are most important to you
4. **Get good advisors**: Experienced lawyers and mentors are invaluable

### Negotiation Approach

1. **Focus on big issues first**: Valuation, board control, liquidation preferences
2. **Understand the implications**: Ask your lawyer to explain the impact of each term
3. **Propose alternatives**: Suggest compromises that work for both sides
4. **Consider the future**: Think about how terms affect future rounds and exits
5. **Maintain relationships**: Negotiate firmly but respectfully

## Common Term Sheet Red Flags

- **Excessive founder vesting**: More than 4 years or no acceleration on acquisition
- **Full ratchet anti-dilution**: Can severely dilute founders in down rounds
- **Investor-controlled board**: Founders lose control of major decisions
- **Excessive option pool**: Creating too large a pool before investment
- **Participation rights with no cap**: Investors "double-dip" in exit proceeds
- **Broad protective provisions**: Giving investors veto power over routine operations

## Did You Know?

üí° **Investor Insight**: Y Combinator's SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) was created in 2013 to simplify seed-stage funding by postponing valuation discussions until the Series A round.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: While many term sheet provisions seem standard, they can vary significantly based on geography. Silicon Valley terms are often more founder-friendly than those in other markets.
