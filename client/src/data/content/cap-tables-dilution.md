# Cap Tables & Dilution

*Reading time: 12 minutes*

## Introduction

A capitalization table (cap table) is a spreadsheet that shows who owns what in your company. It's the definitive record of your company's equity ownership structure, and understanding how it works is essential for making informed decisions about fundraising, employee equity, and the long-term financial health of your startup.

## What is a Cap Table?

A cap table tracks all of your company's securities that can convert into equity, including:

- Common stock (typically held by founders and employees)
- Preferred stock (typically held by investors)
- Stock options (typically for employees)
- Convertible notes and SAFEs
- Warrants

## Basic Cap Table Structure

A standard cap table typically includes:

1. **Names of security holders** (founders, investors, option holders)
2. **Types of securities** they hold
3. **Number of shares** of each type
4. **Ownership percentage** (fully diluted)
5. **Price paid per share** (for investors)

## Understanding Dilution

Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. This typically happens during:

- New funding rounds
- Creation of an employee option pool
- Conversion of notes or SAFEs into equity

### Example of Dilution

If founders own 100% of a company with 1,000,000 shares, and then:
1. Create a 10% option pool (111,111 new shares)
2. Raise money from investors who take 20% (277,778 new shares)

The total shares become 1,388,889, and:
- Founders now own 72% (1,000,000 √∑ 1,388,889)
- Employee options represent 8% (111,111 √∑ 1,388,889)
- Investors own 20% (277,778 √∑ 1,388,889)

## Key Cap Table Concepts

### Fully Diluted Shares

The total number of shares if all convertible securities (options, warrants, convertible notes) were exercised. This gives the most conservative view of ownership.

### Option Pool

A portion of equity reserved for future employees. Typically ranges from 10-20% and is usually created before a funding round (diluting existing shareholders).

### Pre-Money vs. Post-Money Valuation

- **Pre-Money**: Company value before investment
- **Post-Money**: Company value including the new investment

### Anti-Dilution Provisions

Protections for investors that can give them more shares if future rounds are at lower valuations. Common types:
- Full ratchet (most aggressive)
- Weighted average (most common)

## When and How Cap Tables Change

Your cap table will change when you:

1. **Issue new shares** to investors
2. **Grant options** to employees
3. **Expand the option pool**
4. **Convert notes or SAFEs** into equity
5. **Have departures** of employees with unvested equity

## Managing Your Cap Table

Best practices for founders:

- **Start simple**: Use spreadsheets for early stages
- **Use specialized software** as complexity increases (Carta, Pulley, etc.)
- **Model future rounds** to understand dilution impacts
- **Keep it updated** after any equity-related event
- **Share appropriate versions** with investors and stakeholders

## Common Cap Table Mistakes

- **Forgetting about fully-diluted ownership**: Not accounting for options, notes, etc.
- **Incorrect vesting terms**: Not applying vesting schedules properly
- **Neglecting to model future dilution**: Not planning for future funding rounds
- **Over-optimizing for ownership percentage**: Focusing on percentage rather than value
- **Unbalanced founder equity splits**: Not having honest conversations about contributions

## Did You Know?

üí° **Equity Fact**: The "Rule of 3" suggests that after a seed round and 3 rounds of venture funding (A, B, C), founders typically retain only about 25-30% of their company.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The option pool shuffle is a negotiation tactic where investors require you to create or expand the employee option pool before their investment, diluting only the existing shareholders while protecting themselves from this dilution.
