# Unit Economics

*Reading time: 10 minutes*

## Introduction

Unit economics refers to the direct revenues and costs associated with a specific business model, expressed on a per-unit basis. For startups, understanding your unit economics is crucial for proving your business model's viability, guiding growth decisions, and attracting investors. This guide breaks down the fundamentals into clear, actionable concepts for founders.

## Why Unit Economics Matter

Strong unit economics demonstrate:

- Your business can be profitable at scale
- You have a sustainable customer acquisition strategy
- You understand the financial drivers of your business
- You can make data-driven decisions about growth

As venture capitalist Bill Gurley famously noted, "In the absence of a sustainable competitive advantage, even with good unit economics, you are just the latest contestant in The Hunger Games."

## Key Unit Economics Metrics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

CAC measures how much it costs to acquire a single new customer, including all sales and marketing expenses.

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Costs ÷ Number of New Customers Acquired
```

For example, if you spend $10,000 on marketing in a month and acquire 100 new customers, your CAC is $100.

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

LTV is the total revenue you expect to receive from a customer throughout their relationship with your business.

For subscription businesses:
```
LTV = Average Monthly Revenue per Customer × Average Customer Lifetime
```

For non-subscription businesses:
```
LTV = Average Order Value × Average Purchase Frequency × Average Customer Lifespan
```

### The LTV:CAC Ratio

This critical ratio shows whether you're making or losing money on each customer:

```
LTV:CAC Ratio = Lifetime Value ÷ Customer Acquisition Cost
```

A healthy LTV:CAC ratio is typically:
- **<1:1**: Losing money on customers (unsustainable)
- **1:1 to 3:1**: Potentially viable but needs improvement
- **3:1 or higher**: Healthy and attractive to investors

### Payback Period

How long it takes to recover the cost of acquiring a customer:

```
Payback Period = CAC ÷ Monthly Gross Profit per Customer
```

Ideal payback periods:
- **SaaS**: 12-18 months
- **Consumer subscriptions**: 6-12 months
- **E-commerce**: 3-6 months

## Calculating Unit Economics by Business Model

### SaaS/Subscription Business

Key metrics to track:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Churn Rate
- Gross Margin
- CAC by channel

### E-commerce Business

Key metrics to track:
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Purchase Frequency
- Gross Margin
- Return Rate
- CAC by channel

### Marketplace Business

Key metrics to track:
- Take Rate (commission percentage)
- Average Transaction Value
- Transaction Frequency
- Supply-side and Demand-side CAC
- Liquidity metrics

## Improving Your Unit Economics

### Reducing CAC

- **Optimize marketing channels**: Focus spending on channels with lowest CAC
- **Improve conversion rates**: Better website, product, and sales funnel
- **Leverage referrals**: Implement customer referral programs
- **Content marketing**: Build long-term organic customer acquisition
- **Target better**: Refine your ideal customer profile

### Increasing LTV

- **Reduce churn**: Improve product experience and customer service
- **Increase pricing**: Test higher price points if you deliver strong value
- **Cross-sell and upsell**: Offer additional products or premium tiers
- **Expand use cases**: Help customers get more value from your product
- **Loyalty programs**: Reward continued patronage

## Common Unit Economics Mistakes

- **Not including all costs in CAC**: Forgetting sales team salaries, tools, etc.
- **Overestimating customer lifetime**: Being too optimistic about churn
- **Ignoring cohort differences**: Different customer segments have different economics
- **Not accounting for time value of money**: Not discounting future revenue
- **Focusing only on averages**: Missing insights from distribution analysis

## Did You Know?

💡 **Investor Insight**: Many VCs now consider the "Rule of 40" (growth rate + profit margin ≥ 40%) alongside unit economics when evaluating SaaS companies.

⚠️ **Warning**: The so-called "leaky bucket" problem occurs when you focus only on customer acquisition while ignoring retention. Improving retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25-95% according to Bain & Company research.
