## What is a Term Sheet?

A term sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms and conditions of a potential investment in your startup. Think of it as a blueprint for the more detailed legal agreements that will follow.

In simple terms, a term sheet summarizes what you're getting (money), what you're giving (equity), and the rules that will govern the relationship between you and your investors.

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a common seed-stage term sheet:

NexTech Ventures offers a term sheet to Dataflow, a promising data analytics startup:

- **Investment Amount**: $1.5 million
- **Pre-money Valuation**: $6 million
- **Investor Ownership**: 20% post-money
- **Type of Security**: Series Seed Preferred Stock
- **Board Seats**: 3 seats (2 founders, 1 investor)
- **Liquidation Preference**: 1x, non-participating
- **Pro-rata Rights**: Yes
- **Option Pool**: 10% of post-money capitalization

Based on these terms, the founders would retain 72% ownership (90% of the pre-money equity, less 10% for the option pool), with 8% reserved for future employees and 20% going to the investor.

## Key Terms to Understand

When reviewing a term sheet, focus on these critical elements:

### Economic Terms:

- **Valuation**: How much your company is worth before investment (pre-money) and after (post-money)
- **Investment Amount**: How much cash you're receiving
- **Liquidation Preference**: Who gets paid first if the company is sold or liquidated
- **Option Pool**: Equity reserved for future employees (usually comes from founders' portion)
- **Vesting**: Schedule for earning equity ownership over time

### Control Terms:

- **Board Composition**: Who gets seats on the board of directors
- **Protective Provisions**: Special investor rights to approve or block certain actions
- **Anti-dilution Provisions**: Protections for investors if future rounds are at lower valuations
- **Information Rights**: What financial information you must provide to investors
- **Right of First Refusal**: Investors' rights to maintain their percentage ownership in future rounds

## Why Term Sheets Matter

Understanding term sheets is crucial because:

1. **They determine ownership**: The terms directly affect how much of your company you'll own.

2. **They impact control**: Many terms affect who makes decisions about your company's future.

3. **They set precedents**: Terms in early rounds often carry forward to later rounds.

4. **They affect future fundraising**: Certain terms can make raising your next round more difficult.

## Tips for Negotiating Term Sheets

- **Focus on the big issues**: Valuation, board control, and liquidation preferences impact you most.

- **Understand the norms**: What's standard for your industry, stage, and location? Don't fight over standard terms.

- **Get legal help**: Have an experienced startup attorney review before signing.

- **Be open to compromise**: Every term sheet involves give and take.

- **Remember the relationship**: You'll be working with these investors for years, so balance getting good terms with starting the relationship positively.

## Did You Know?

ðŸ’¡ In 2015, Y Combinator introduced SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) notes as an alternative to traditional term sheets. These simplified documents postpone valuation discussions until a company raises a priced round, and they've become extremely popular for pre-seed and seed investments.

## Diagram Suggestion

A visual representation showing:
- A diagram of cap table changes before and after the investment
- A decision tree showing how liquidation preferences work in different exit scenarios
- A comparison table of founder-friendly vs. investor-friendly terms
- A visualization of how dilution works with the creation of an option pool

This helps founders understand the numerical impact of term sheet provisions and visualize how different terms affect their ownership and potential outcomes.
