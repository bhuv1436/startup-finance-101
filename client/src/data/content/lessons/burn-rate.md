# Understanding Burn Rate

*Reading time: 4 minutes*

## What is Burn Rate?

Burn rate is the speed at which your startup uses up its cash reserves before becoming profitable. Think of it like watching your bank account drain each month when you have expenses but limited or no income.

In simple terms, burn rate measures how quickly your company is spending money, typically calculated as a monthly figure.

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a real example: Imagine a tech startup called LaunchPad that has raised $600,000 in seed funding.

LaunchPad has:
- $15,000/month in developer salaries
- $3,000/month for office space
- $5,000/month for marketing
- $2,000/month for software tools and services

With total monthly expenses of $25,000 and no revenue yet, LaunchPad has a burn rate of $25,000 per month.

## How to Calculate Burn Rate

The formula is straightforward:

**Gross Burn Rate = Total Monthly Expenses**

For companies with revenue, you can also calculate:

**Net Burn Rate = Total Monthly Expenses - Monthly Revenue**

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. Add up all your monthly expenses (salaries, rent, marketing, etc.)
2. Subtract your monthly revenue (if any)
3. The result is your monthly burn rate

### Using Our Calculator:

1. Enter your current cash balance (e.g., $600,000)
2. Enter your monthly expenses (e.g., $25,000)
3. Enter your monthly revenue, if any
4. The calculator will show your burn rate and runway (how many months until you run out of cash)

## Why Tracking Burn Rate is Crucial

Understanding your burn rate is important because:

1. **It determines your runway**: If LaunchPad has $600,000 in the bank and burns $25,000/month, they have a 24-month runway ($600,000 Ã· $25,000 = 24 months).

2. **It guides fundraising timing**: Startups should typically start raising their next round when they have 6-9 months of runway left. For LaunchPad, that means beginning fundraising efforts at around the 15-18 month mark.

3. **It forces financial discipline**: Tracking burn rate helps identify unnecessary expenses and prioritize spending on what truly matters.

4. **It's a key investor metric**: Investors will always ask about your burn rate to evaluate how responsibly you're managing their money.

## Tips to Reduce Your Burn Rate

If you need to extend your runway, consider these strategies:

- **Renegotiate contracts** with service providers for better terms
- **Implement hiring freezes** during critical cash conservation periods
- **Consider remote work** to reduce office costs
- **Use freelancers** instead of full-time hires for specialized tasks
- **Focus marketing** on channels with proven ROI
- **Delay non-essential purchases** until you've secured additional funding

## Did You Know?

ðŸ’¡ During the 2008 financial crisis, many prominent startups that survived (including Airbnb and Uber) adopted what's known as the "40% rule" â€” reducing burn rate by 40% immediately when market conditions worsened, which dramatically extended their runway and saved them from failure.

## Diagram Suggestion

A visual representation showing:
- A water tank (representing cash reserves)
- Water flowing out at different rates (representing different burn rates)
- Markers showing runway length at each burn rate
- A refill pipe (representing new funding) that needs to arrive before the tank empties

This visualizes how changes in burn rate directly impact the time you have to achieve milestones or secure additional funding.
