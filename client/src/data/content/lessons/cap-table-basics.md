# Understanding Cap Tables

*Reading time: 5 minutes*

## What is a Cap Table?

A cap table (short for capitalization table) is a spreadsheet that shows who owns what in your startup. Think of it as the ownership map of your companyâ€”it tracks all the equity, options, convertible notes, and other securities issued by your business.

In simple terms, it answers the questions: "Who owns this company?" and "How much does each owner have?"

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a typical early-stage startup called CodeCraft:

After incorporation, CodeCraft's cap table looks like this:
- Founder A: 500,000 shares (50%)
- Founder B: 300,000 shares (30%)
- Founder C: 200,000 shares (20%)
- Total shares: 1,000,000 (100%)

Then, CodeCraft creates a 10% employee option pool (111,111 new shares) and raises $500,000 from an angel investor at a $4 million pre-money valuation.

The investor gets 111,111 shares (10% of the post-money company).

After these changes, CodeCraft's cap table becomes:
- Founder A: 500,000 shares (41%)
- Founder B: 300,000 shares (24.5%)
- Founder C: 200,000 shares (16.5%)
- Option Pool: 111,111 shares (9%)
- Angel Investor: 111,111 shares (9%)
- Total shares: 1,222,222 (100%)

## How to Create a Simple Cap Table

You can create a basic cap table in three steps:

1. **List all shareholders** (founders, investors, option holders)
2. **Record their holdings** (number of shares and type)
3. **Calculate ownership percentages** (divide each person's shares by the total)

For a more detailed cap table, you'd also track:
- Vesting schedules
- Option strike prices
- Liquidation preferences
- Conversion rights
- Anti-dilution provisions

## Why Cap Tables Matter

Understanding your cap table is crucial because:

1. **It shows true ownership**: The cap table reveals everyone's actual stake in the company.

2. **It helps with planning**: Before raising money or granting options, you can model how these actions will affect ownership.

3. **It's required for fundraising**: Investors will always ask to see your cap table before investing.

4. **It affects your control**: The distribution of shares determines voting rights and who controls major decisions.

## Tips for Managing Your Cap Table

- **Start clean and stay organized**: Begin with a clear structure and update it after every equity-related event.

- **Use fully-diluted calculations**: Always calculate percentages based on fully-diluted shares (including all options, convertible notes, etc.)

- **Plan for future rounds**: Model how subsequent funding rounds will affect ownership percentages.

- **Consider using dedicated software**: As your cap table grows more complex, tools like Carta, Pulley, or Shareworks can help manage it.

- **Review regularly with co-founders**: Ensure all founders understand the cap table and implications of equity-related decisions.

## Did You Know?

ðŸ’¡ Founders are often surprised by how much dilution occurs over multiple funding rounds. A study by Noam Wasserman of Harvard Business School found that by the time of a startup's Series D funding round, founders typically retain only 11-16% of their company's equity.

## Diagram Suggestion

A visual representation showing:
- A pie chart of initial founder ownership
- A second pie chart showing ownership after option pool creation
- A third pie chart showing ownership after investor funding
- Arrows between the charts showing the dilution process

This helps visualize how each equity event changes the ownership distribution and demonstrates the concept of dilution in a clear, visual way.
