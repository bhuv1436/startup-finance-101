# Calculating Your Startup's Runway

*Reading time: 5 minutes*

## What is Runway?

Runway is the amount of time your startup can operate before running out of cash, assuming no additional revenue or funding. It's like a countdown clock showing how long you can stay in business with your current resources.

In simple terms, runway tells you how many months you have left to either become profitable, raise more money, or reduce expenses.

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a typical scenario:

HealthTech, a digital health startup, has:
- $850,000 in the bank
- Monthly expenses of $75,000
- Monthly revenue of $10,000

Their net burn rate is $65,000 per month ($75,000 expenses - $10,000 revenue).

Their runway calculation is:
$850,000 Ã· $65,000 = 13.1 months

This means HealthTech has approximately 13 months before they run out of cash if nothing changes.

## How to Calculate Runway

The formula is straightforward:

```
Runway (months) = Current Cash Balance Ã· Monthly Net Burn Rate
```

Where:
- Net Burn Rate = Monthly Expenses - Monthly Revenue

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. Determine your current cash balance (from your bank accounts)
2. Calculate your monthly expenses (salaries, rent, services, etc.)
3. Subtract your monthly revenue (if any) to get your net burn rate
4. Divide your cash balance by your net burn rate

### Using Our Runway Calculator:

## Why Runway is Vital for Startups

Understanding your runway is crucial because:

1. **It determines fundraising timing**: You should typically start raising your next round when you have 6-9 months of runway remaining.

2. **It affects hiring decisions**: You shouldn't hire new employees if you can't afford their salaries through your fundraising timeline.

3. **It influences growth strategies**: With limited runway, you might need to prioritize revenue-generating activities over pure growth.

4. **It's a key investor metric**: Investors will always ask about your runway to gauge how urgently you need their capital.

## Tips for Extending Your Runway

If you need more time, consider these strategies:

- **Implement a hiring freeze** until after your next funding round
- **Renegotiate contracts** with vendors and suppliers
- **Consider part-time or contract workers** instead of full-time employees
- **Focus on revenue-generating activities** to improve cash flow
- **Cut non-essential expenses** like fancy offices or premium software
- **Prioritize customers who pay upfront** or on shorter payment terms

## Did You Know?

ðŸ’¡ During the 2020 pandemic, many venture capitalists advised their portfolio companies to maintain at least 24 months of runway (double the usual recommendation of 12 months). Companies that followed this advice were better positioned to weather the subsequent funding slowdown in 2022-2023.

## Diagram Suggestion

A visual representation showing:
- A timeline with monthly markers
- Cash balance shown as a descending line
- Burn rate represented as the slope of the line
- A "danger zone" when runway drops below 6 months
- A "fundraising zone" indicating when to start raising your next round

This helps founders visualize their cash trajectory and plan critical milestones accordingly.
